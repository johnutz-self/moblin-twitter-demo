Moblin Twitter Component and Demo Application

This distribution exists for three purposes:

1. To provide a simple introduction to the steps involved in creating
a well behaved Intel Developer Marketplace for Moblin re-licensable
utility component. 

Both the demo application and the component provide an example of how to
utilize the IADP API. 

In particular, note the differences between the Intel Atom Developer 
Program API (IADP API) calls made in the application and the IADP API 
calls made in the component - The demo app initializes and maintains 
the relationship with IADP and contains the calls to the crash reporting 
code and the component's role is limited to ensuring that the calling 
app is authorized to use the component.

2. To show how to levarage Mojito, a social data service provided as
part of moblin:

      http://moblin.org/projects/mojito

The twitter component provides the following apis:

TWTR_put()  TWTR_get()  TWTR_init()  TWTR_shutdown()  TWTR_lastError()

3. To show how that component can be called from an application.

Note that while the component interacts with Mojito to operate
the relationship with twitter, the application needs no knowledge of,
and has no knowledge of, Mojito.

The demo application is written using GTK as the UI toolset and is
focused on expository goals instead of providing the features that
would be expected in a robust twitter client. It provides the simplest
possible user interface to avoid distracting from the use of the
IADP api and the component's API.

The implementation of both the component and the demo are discussed in
great detail in the Readme.txt file that is included in the
distribution and in the comments in the code.
